In-progress
Initial state

A project that improves low quality football game and tracks formation changes using tracking-by-detection

1. Improve image quality
  - Sharpening filtering
  - Super resolution

2. Player detection
  - YOLOv8 for people detection

3. Team filtering
  - Based on white / black uniform
  - Make a mask for distingifh each team
  - HSV color space

4. Clustering formation
  - Kmeans to distingish each positions

5. Formation visualization
  - Convex Hull / Delaunay Triangulation 

6. Training model
  - GNN
  - Positional Encoding
